# javascript
This is my javascript sandbox where I explore and learn javascript.
I explore the building blocks of the language.
I also code simple snippets to grasp concepts in bit sizes.
To use knowledge gained, I code some projects along the learning wway to
solidify my grasp of the javascript language.
